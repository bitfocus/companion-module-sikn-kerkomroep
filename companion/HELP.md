Companion-module-sikn-kerkomroep

This module will check if a church with specified code is live at the moment.
Kerkomroep does not supply an API so this is reversed engineered.
The behaviour may change any moment unaccounced.

There a two config items: 
the id of the church (available in the url of the kerkomroep page of the church)
the frequency to check the status of the stream
